== About

I interned at Prime Publishing, LLC this summer as a Marketing Analyst. A large part of this job involved running many reports in Google Analytics in regards to traffic sources and web traffic details. Originally the analysts manually went into the Google Analytics interface and pulled each data point individually. I developed this site to speed up the process and gather all of the data points at once.

== Under The Hood

This is a Ruby on Rails app that depends on the Garb gem to use the Google Analytics API. The code is very controller heavy due to the amount of individual queries to Google for the data. If I had more resources I would enqueue some of these calls into background jobs and make an actual model for these data reports. Instead I just display results in a view.
